== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What can I do if the cost field is not saving? =
If even after clicking "Update" on the product edit page the cost field is not saving, please try to change this option:
**- Cost field position**

= What is the easiest way to export the full inventory (cost of all goods)? =
Probably the easiest way of doing it would be through the default WooCommerce export, over:

First, you have to enable two options:

- Products > Quick and Bulk Edit > Cost field > Add "Cost" field to product "Quick Edit"

And then you can follow these steps:

1. Access your products listing page
2. Filter by the category
3. Select all
4. Click edit on "Bulk actions" dropdown
5. Edit the field you want
